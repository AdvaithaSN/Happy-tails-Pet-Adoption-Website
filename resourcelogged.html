    <h2>Behavioral Training Tips for Pets</h2>
    <img src="images/r2.jpg" alt="resource 2" width="50%">
    <section>
      <h3>Start Early</h3>
      <p>Begin training your pet as soon as you bring them home. Early training helps establish good habits and prevents unwanted behaviors from developing.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Use Positive Reinforcement</h3>
      <p>Positive reinforcement, such as treats, praise, and affection, is a powerful tool for training. Reward your pet immediately after they exhibit a desired behavior to reinforce that behavior.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Consistency is Key</h3>
      <p>Be consistent in your training methods and commands. Use the same cues and rewards consistently to avoid confusion.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Basic Commands</h3>
      <p>Teach your pet basic commands like sit, stay, come, and leave it. These commands are not only practical but also help establish you as the leader.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Socialization</h3>
      <p>Socialize your pet with other animals and people from a young age. Proper socialization can prevent fearfulness and aggression later in life.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Potty Training</h3>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Leash Training</h3>
      <p>Teach your pet to walk calmly on a leash using positive reinforcement. Start with short walks in quiet areas and gradually increase the duration and complexity of walks.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Addressing Undesirable Behaviors</h3>
      <p>If your pet exhibits undesirable behaviors like chewing, digging, or excessive barking, redirect their attention to a more appropriate activity and provide positive reinforcement when they comply.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Seek Professional Help</h3>
      <p>If you're struggling with training or dealing with more complex behavioral issues, consider seeking guidance from a professional trainer or behaviorist.</p>
